# odin-recipes

Review of my learnings - 

The process taught me how to go about creating the main index.html and then create the page structure of each recipe and then link back each recipe to index.html.

Each commit was a challenge. I have brushed upon my commiting skills, learning when to commit, how to write concise and simple commit messages and committing often.

The use of images, links, lists, headings, etc, has made me improve my understanding of the precise use of elements and relevant attributes. The HTML boilerplate has become second nature to me now.

I will be reviewing this project further while i'm studying future topics to see areas where I can improve the project and make it look & feel better.

A lot was learnt doing this project, thank you TOP.
