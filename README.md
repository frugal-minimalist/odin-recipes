Review of my learnings - 

The process taught me how to go about creating the main index.html and then create the page structure of each recipe and then link back each recipe to index.html.

Each commit was a challenge. I have brushed upon my commiting skills, learning when to commit, how to write concise and simple commit messages and committing often.

The use of images, links, lists, headings, etc, has made me improve my understanding of the precise use of elements and relevant attributes. The HTML boilerplate has become second nature to me now.

After learning CSS, I've come back to review this project. I have created stylesheets for each recipe and the index. Added various different styles to each recipe using class, id and type selectors. This helped me brush upon my CSS skills and understand and implement concepts like specificity, grouping selectors, etc.

With my future learnings, I will revisit the project and try to improve it further on.

A lot was learnt doing this project, thank you TOP.
