           <p>This is not a prettiest chicken curry you will lay your eyes on. But what it lacks in looks, it makes up for in flavor.
             Nagarjuna Style Chilli Chicken is a salty, umami curry with a searing heat that is off the charts ü•µ.
             Named after the popular local eatery that made it famous, it is not a dish for the faint-hearted.
             The over-zealous of use green chillies renders a gravy so sharply moreish,
             it'll make you wince (though in a good way, if you know what I mean).</p>

           <p>The recipe is straightforward and does not require lot of ingredients.
             Pair it with some ghee rice or biryani for an easy, satisfying and sweat-inducing meal. 
             And have a glass (or two) of ice water handy! </p>
