           <p>In South India, bone broth is locally called Kaal Soup. Military hotels across South India are popular for traditional meat dishes, with some must-try options including kaal soup, biryani, and curries. 
            Kaal soup prepared at home differs significantly from its counterpart in military hotels.</p>

           <p>Homemade kaal soup always incorporates a fried and ground coconut-based masala, while military hotels abstain from using oil and exclude ground masala in their recipe. 
            This soup proves to be a healthy choice, especially for children and elderly individuals who may struggle with digesting strong masalas. 
            It serves as a soothing option for patients experiencing viral fever, cold, or cough."</p>
